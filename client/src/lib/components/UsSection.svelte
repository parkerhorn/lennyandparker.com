            Six years ago, we found each other on the outskirts of the internet.
            What started as a simple connection has grown into a beautiful
            partnership filled with love, laughter, and countless adventures.
            From late-night conversations to exploring new places together,
            we've built a life that we're excited to celebrate with all of you.
          </p>

          <p class="font-serif text-foreground leading-relaxed text-justify fluid-body">
            Our journey has taught us that love isn't just about finding the
            perfect person, but about growing together, supporting each other's
            dreams, and creating a home filled with warmth and understanding. We
            can't wait to take this next step and make our commitment official
            in front of our closest friends and family.
